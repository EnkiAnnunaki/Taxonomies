# Taxonomies
Easy access to IAB Tech Lab taxonomies, as listed below

### Content Taxonomy 
The Content Taxonomy provides a common language that can be used when describing content or the aboutness of a webpage, applicaiton, or video. Typical uses of the content taxonomy are contextual targeting and brand safety.

### Audience Taxonomy 
Provide common nomenclature for audience segment names to improve comparability of data across different providers. It is a key element in IAB Tech Lab’s Data Transparency Standard (datalabel.org), which facilitates consistent labeling of audience data by first-party and third-party sources. The Audience Taxonomy also provides a mechanism to make segmentation approaches much clearer (categorically) by introducing Tier 1 level labelling that designates whether the segment describes attribution that are demographic, interest-based, or purchase-intent based. 

### Ad Product Taxonomy
The Ad Product Taxonomy establishes a standardized nomenclature for describing the product or service being advertised within a creative unit. It aims to provide publishers with stronger signals to, 1) control the types of ads that are delivered via automated channels and, 2) measure the performance of those ads against internal KPIs.


## Versioning Policy

IAB Tech Lab Taxonimies can be updated as often as once a month if there are non-breaking improvements to be released such as new rows that do not require updates to the taxonomy's hierarchical structure. Errata, such as clarifications or corrections to descriptions not materially impacting the specification itself, are also addressed during monthly updates.

The format for version numbering includes major and minor versions where major version numbers represent breaking changes and minor version numbers represent non-breaking changes. For example, Audience Taxonomy 1.1 is a non-breaking update to Audience Taxonomy 1.0 whereas Content Taxonomy 3.0 may not be used alongside earlier versions (i.e. Content Taxonomy 1.0 through Content Taxonomy 2.2).
